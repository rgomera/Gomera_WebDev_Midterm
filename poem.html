       <h1>Never Give Up</h1>
       <p>I am a man will be successful, in order that to happen I must surpass the all the challenges even though its painful.
         <br/> I faced the all challenges with passion, hardwork and determination.
         <br/> I committed mistakes along the way but never giveup is my way.
         <br/> Learned from those mistakes and make me a better one.
         <br/> Doing the things that I enjoy the most makes me a successful one.
         <br/> Never Giveup is my way, if I dont have a strength to face the challenges along the way. 
         <br/> To God I always pray, I am a man who never give up.
